## 🔧 Root Cause Analysis

### Issue 1: Translation Keys Not Being Used
**Problem**: UI components are displaying the translation key names (e.g., `playback_speed`) instead of calling `t("playback_speed")`.

**Affected Areas**:
- Settings screens (Images 4-8)
- Load from URL dialog (Image 9)
- Voice command categories (Images 11-12)

**Solution**: Update UI components to use the translation hook `t()` for all text display.

### Issue 2: Missing Translation Keys
**Problem**: Some keys exist in English but are missing from other language files.

**Affected Keys**:
- `playback_speed`
- `speed_0_5`, `speed_1_25`, `speed_1_5`, `speed_2_0`
- `normal_speed`
- `next_video`, `previous_video`, `replay`

**Solution**: Add missing keys to all 12 language JSON files.

### Issue 3: Hardcoded Text
**Problem**: The Chinese text "動畫效果展示" appears to be hardcoded.

**Location**: Settings screen (Image 8, 10)

**Solution**: Replace with `t("animation_demo")` and ensure key exists in all languages.
