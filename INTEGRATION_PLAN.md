- Test smooth scrolling and animations
- Verify memory usage
- Check for any performance regressions

## Phase 5: Deployment & Migration

### 5.1 Gradual Rollout
- Deploy new components alongside existing ones
- A/B test new vs old designs
- Gather user feedback
- Monitor crash reports and performance metrics

### 5.2 Full Migration
- Replace old components with new ones
- Remove deprecated code
- Update documentation
- Train support team on new features

## Implementation Priority

### High Priority (Week 1-2)
1. âœ… Complete design system foundation
2. ðŸ”„ Modernize home screen with new components
3. ðŸ”„ Update player screen with dual voice control hub
4. ðŸ”„ Ensure all existing functionality is preserved

### Medium Priority (Week 3-4)
1. Update remaining tab screens (favorites, community, settings)
2. Add advanced animations and transitions
3. Implement responsive design improvements
4. Add haptic feedback and micro-interactions

### Low Priority (Week 5+)
1. Performance optimizations
2. Advanced accessibility features
3. Additional UI polish
4. Documentation updates
